  Our life is frittered in detail ... simplify, simplify.

  This work aims to strip a trading system to its core - trading rules. In particular, 
the focus is on simple trading rules since it much easier to explain the 
profitability and behavior of such rules. 

  While the projects implements a trend following strategy on the Exxon Mobil stock,
it is premised on the following fundamental questions
-    What makes a good trading rule? 
-    When does the rule work and why does it work?      
-    How successful should you expect to be by trading that rule?
-    How would this rule fare when you have a limit on how much you can lose?
